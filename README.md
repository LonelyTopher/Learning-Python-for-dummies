# Learning-Python-for-dummies
All my progress while learning to master python with Python for dummies.

I skip some of the beginning chapters because the information either wasn't relevant to me while going throught the contents of my workboork,
or because I already knew the contense of the chapter prior to reading. The information in this repository is relevant to me, and not 
for the purpose of other's using my learning technique to learn Python.

Rather, for me to also record/track my progress as I learn, to have something to return to, and to learn and understand the way that
GitHub even works. It serves me, without the interest of other people.
