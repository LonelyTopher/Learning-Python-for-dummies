A semantic error occurs when the code is essentially correct but the implementation is wrong. Logical errors occur when the developer's thinking is faulty. In many cases this sort of error happens when the developer uses a relational or logical operator incorrectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, logical errors can happen in all sorts of other ways, too. For example, a developer might think that data is always stores on the local hard drive, which means that the application may behave in an unusual manner when it attempts to load data from a network drive instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical errors are quite hard to fix because the problem isn't within the actual code, yet the code itself is incorrectly defined. The thought process that went into creating the code is faulty; therefore, the developer who created the error is less likely to find it. Smart developers use a second pair of eyes to help spot logical errors. Having a formal application specification also helps because the logic behind the tasks the application performs is ususally given in a formal review."
